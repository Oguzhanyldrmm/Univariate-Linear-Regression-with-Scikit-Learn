# Project Description
•This project is a univariate linear regression model that predicts the population of Antalya City using Python programming language. The goal of this project is to create a simple but effective model that can accurately predict the population of Antalya City based on historical data which is showing the population of Turkey between 2000 and 2021.

•I used one of the most popular machine learning library that is Scikit-Learn

•I have a same project which has linear regression functions and algorithms from scratch. My goal is showing difference between library versus from scratch in same project. You can see in my repositories.
